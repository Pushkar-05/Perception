## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Darknet with the PR2 robot using ROS (Robot Operating System) and Gazebo simulations for real-time object and human detection.

## Features

- Real-time object and human detection.
- Integration with PR2 robot and Gazebo simulations.
- ROS-based implementation for seamless control and interaction.

## Getting Started
